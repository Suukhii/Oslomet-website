                When we were going to test our site for accessibility we used the chrome extension lighthouse. We hosted our site on GitHub which made it really easy to use the automated test software on our site. 
                After running the test on our site we got the results that you can see below in the picture. When using lighthouse it also gives you a concise recap of why a site gets the score it does which can be allot of help in making the score better and improving the accessibility of a site.

                We have tried to make sure that all the text should be readable for the users even if they have some sort of visual impairment. 
                We also made sure that the site scales with the browser and scales for mobile view. When deciding on what font to use we decided to use the sans serif font because it is a very basic font that is widely used across the internet and other places. 
                This makes it so people are very used to seeing it which especially helps people with visual impairment discern what is written. We used alt text for our images so that if the user cannot display the image for any reason or they use a screen reader then they will still get the same information from the images as they would if they could see the images. 
                The navigation bar at the top is a way we also tried to make the site more accessible, it stands out allot from the rest of all the pages and the background of it and the text makes it so that it is easy to read what the different page names are. 
                Above the navigation bar there is also the title of the page in big letters so that it is easy to see if you clicked on the right page immediately and to see what the page is about.
            </p>
            <p>
                On our site we decided not to use any javascript, this is because we werenâ€™t quite sure if the ways we wanted to implement it into our site would be perceived as correct and if it would have gotten us potentially any negative points for the exam. 
                So even if it might have helped increase the accessibility of our site by adding some more functionalities we did not want to take the risk of it being perceived as incorrect use since we could not gain any points from using it only docked points if our use is perceived as incorrect.
