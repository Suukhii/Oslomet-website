            <h2>The Impact of Technology on Society</h2>

                With the advent of digital media, the potential for fake news, bullshit and alternative facts have proliferated. The creation of images, sound and text through artificial intelligence could increase the speed and scale of this phenomenon and drastically influence how we interpret current events, further influencing our political attitudes and elections.
                The use of AI-generated images have already been used in the U.S election campaign leading up to the coming 2024 Presidential Election. In 2025 Norway will host its Parliamentary Election, how should we prepare for the use of this technology? 
            The Norwegian government have asked for advice on how to deal with the use of AI in political campaigns and elections. The current government proposal is that a law should be in place before the 2025 Norwegian election, banning all use of AI in political campaignsâ€”including all AI-generated text, images, sound, and video. 
            Should this law be implemented, and what might be the consequences?

            <p>Even if the law is difficult to enforce, it should still be passed into action to discourage use of it. If the law is not implemented, 
                political leaders might use feign ignorance if their political view is different from the societal norms. Striking the right balance between regulating ai in 
                political campaigns and allowing innovation can be challenging. While some argue for strict regulations to prevent ai misuse, others believe that innovation in 
                campaign technology can lead to more engaging and informative political discourse. It's worth noting that addressing the ethical challenges posed by ai in political campaigns 
                often involves a combination of legal regulations, technological safeguards, and public education to ensure responsible and fair campaign practices. But ultimately politics 
                will always be more healthy in a hypothetical world where artificial inteligence never exists.</p>
